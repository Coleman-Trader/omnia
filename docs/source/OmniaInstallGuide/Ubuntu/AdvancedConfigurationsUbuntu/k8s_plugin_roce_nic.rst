Kubernetes plugin for RoCE NIC
===================================

.. caution:: Kubernetes plugin for the RoCE NIC is only supported on the Ubuntu clusters (not on RHEL/Rocky Linux clusters).

Few important things to keep in mind before proceeding with the installation:

1. Defined network interfaces with their respective IP ranges (start and end) should be assigned.
2. Number of entries in the ``input/roce_plugin_config.yml`` should be equal to number of RoCE interfaces available in the RoCE pod.
3. VLAN NICs are not supported.
4. This playbook supports the deployment of up to 8 RoCE NIC interfaces.
5. In a scenario where there are two nodes with two separate NICs, the admin must ensure to use aliasing to make the NIC names similar before executing ``deploy_roce_plugin.yml``.
6. Omnia does not validate any parameter entries in the ``input/roce_plugin_config.yml``. It is the user's responsibility to provide correct inputs for the required parameters. In case of any errors encountered due to incorrect entries, delete and re-install the plugin with the correct inputs. For more information, `click here <../../../Troubleshooting/FAQ/Ubuntu/Provision.html>`_.

Install the plugin
-------------------

**Prerequisites**

* Ensure Kubernetes is set up on the cluster with ``flannel`` or ``calico`` as the input for the ``k8s_cni`` parameter. For the complete list of parameters, `click here <../OmniaCluster/schedulerinputparams.html#id12>`_.
* Ensure that the Broadcom RoCE drivers are installed on the nodes.
* Ensure that additional NICs have been configured using the ``server_spec_update.yml`` playbook. For more information on how to configure additional NICs, `click here <../../../Utils/AdditionalNIC.html>`_.
* Ensure that the ``{"name": "roce_plugin"}`` entry is present in the ``software_config.json`` and the same config has been used while executing the ``local_repo.yml`` playbook.
* Ensure to update the below mentioned parameters in ``input/roce_plugin_config.yml``:

**To install the plugin, run the** ``deploy_roce_plugin.yml`` **playbook**

Run the playbook using the following command: ::

    cd omnia/scheduler
    ansible-playbook deploy_roce_plugin.yml -i inventory

Where the inventory should be the same as the one used to setup Kubernetes on the cluster.

.. note:: A config file named ``roce_plugin.json`` is located in ``omnia\input\config\ubuntu\22.04\``. This config file contains all the details about the Kubernetes plugin for the RoCE NIC. Here is an example of the config file: ::

       {
           "roce_plugin": {
             "cluster": [
             {
               "package": "k8s-rdma-shared-dev-plugin",
               "url": "https://github.com/Mellanox/k8s-rdma-shared-dev-plugin.git",
               "type": "git",
               "version": "v1.5.2"
             },
             {
               "package": "ghcr.io/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multus-cni",
               "tag": "v4.1.4-thick",
               "type": "image"
             },
             {
               "package": "ghcr.io/k8snetworkplumbingwg/whereabouts",
               "tag": "v0.8.0",
               "type": "image"
             },
             {
               "package": "ghcr.io/mellanox/k8s-rdma-shared-dev-plugin",
               "tag": "v1.5.2",
               "type": "image"
             },
             {
               "package": "docker.io/roman8rcm/roce-test",
               "tag": "229.2.32.0",
               "type": "image"
             }
             ]
           }
       }

.. caution:: After running the ``deploy_roce_plugin.yml`` playbook, the RDMA pods will be in ``CrashLoopBackOff`` state and the RoCE pods will be in ``pending`` state. This is a known issue and the resolution can be found `here <>`_.

Delete the plugin
------------------

To delete the plugin, run the ``delete_roce_plugin.yml`` playbook using the following command: ::

    cd omnia/scheduler
    ansible-playbook delete_roce_plugin.yml -i inventory
