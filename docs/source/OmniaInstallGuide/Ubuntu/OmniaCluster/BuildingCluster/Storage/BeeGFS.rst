BeeGFS bolt on
--------------

BeeGFS is a hardware-independent POSIX parallel file system (a.k.a. Software-defined Parallel Storage) developed with a strong focus on performance and designed for ease of use, simple installation, and management.

.. note:: For clusters running on Ubuntu 24.04 OS, the supported BeeGFS version is ``7.4.5``.

**Pre Requisites before installing BeeGFS client**

* Ensure that the BeeGFS server is set up using the `linked steps <../../../../../Appendices/BeeGFSServer.html>`_.
* Ensure that a ``connAuthFile`` is configured on the server as explained `here <../../../../../Appendices/BeeGFSServer.html>`_

.. caution:: Configuring a ``connAuthFile`` is now mandatory. Services will no longer start if a ``connAuthFile`` is not configured

* Ensure that the following ports are open for TCP and UDP connectivity:

        +------+-----------------------------------+
        | Port | Service                           |
        +======+===================================+
        | 8008 | Management service (beegfs-mgmtd) |
        +------+-----------------------------------+
        | 8003 | Storage service (beegfs-storage)  |
        +------+-----------------------------------+
        | 8004 | Client service (beegfs-client)    |
        +------+-----------------------------------+
        | 8005 | Metadata service (beegfs-meta)    |
        +------+-----------------------------------+
        | 8006 | Helper service (beegfs-helperd)   |
        +------+-----------------------------------+


 To install and start ``firewalld`` on your Ubuntu clusters, use the following commands:

    1. Command 1: ``apt install firewalld -y``

    2. Command 2: ``systemctl start firewalld``

 Once ``firewalld`` is up and running, use the below set of commands to open up the required TCP and UDP ports:

    1. Command 1: ``firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=<port number>/tcp``

    2. Command 2: ``firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=<port number>/udp``

    3. Command 3: ``firewall-cmd --reload``

    4. Command 4: ``systemctl status firewalld``


**Installing the BeeGFS client via Omnia**

After the required parameters are filled in ``input/storage_config.yml``, Omnia installs BeeGFS on all nodes while executing the ``storage.yml`` playbook.

.. caution:: Do not remove or comment any lines in the ``input/storage_config.yml`` file.

   :file: ../../../Tables/storage_config.csv
   :header-rows: 1
   :keepspace:

.. note::
    * BeeGFS client-server communication can take place over TCP or RDMA. If RDMA support is required, set ``beegfs_rdma_support`` should be set to true. Also, OFED should be installed on all cluster nodes.
    * For BeeGFS communication happening over RDMA, the ``beegfs_mgmt_server`` should be provided with the Infiniband IP of the management server.
    * The parameter inventory refers to the `inventory file <../../../../samplefiles.html>`_ listing all relevant nodes.

If ``input/storage_config.yml`` is populated before running ``omnia.yml``, BeeGFS client will be set up during the execution of ``omnia.yml``.

If ``omnia.yml`` is not leveraged to set up BeeGFS, execute the ``storage.yml`` playbook : ::

    cd storage
    ansible-playbook storage.yml -i inventory

.. note:: To run the ``storage.yml`` playbook independently from the ``omnia.yml`` playbook on Intel Gaudi nodes, start by executing the ``performance_profile.yml`` playbook. Once thatâ€™s done, you can run the ``storage.yml`` playbook separately.
