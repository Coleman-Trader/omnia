Telemetry
==========

â¦¾ **Why does the telemetry service fail on a compute node and the Telemetry database remains empty after executing** ``omnia.yml`` **in a cross-OS setup where the OIM is running Ubuntu 22.04 and the compute nodes are on Ubuntu 20.04?**

**Potential Cause**: This issue is encountered when there is a mismatch of libc version between the OIM (running on Ubuntu 22.04) and the compute node (running on Ubuntu 20.04).

**Resolution**: To ensure proper functioning of the telemetry service, ensure that the same libc version is present on the OIM and the compute nodes.
